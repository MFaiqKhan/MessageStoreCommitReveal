# MessageStoreCommitReveal

### This code isn't audited and shouldn't be used in production.


This is a simple contract that allows you to store a testimoney/description in the smart contract in the form of hash
and then you can confirm the description again by providing the same description
if the hash matches than the description is confirmed
@dev caution , the message provided must be 100% same , if not then it will not match
